### Welcome to goooop

Your starter pack includes;

- 60ml bottle of unflavoured goooop&trade; propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) at a ratio of 40/60 infused with active Cannbionds.
- 1ml syringe
- Empty 10ml vial
- Wild Cherry flavour concentrate

#### Create your flavour

- Open your empty 10ml vial and use the syringe to add 1ml of flavour to the bottle. Flavour ratio should be around 10%, so when you fill the vial up with the unflavoured goooop&trade; it'll be about right.
- Put the nozzle in, screw the cap on & give it a shake
- basta

### Tips

- Don't fill your tank very full. A little goes a long way
- You may wish to change your e-juice flavour or strength during the day. Have two or three seperate tanks for the same vape so that you can swap different types in and out at will
